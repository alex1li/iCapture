This is our final project for our ECE 3140 class. We could make any project as long as we used the FRDM-K64F microcontroller.

iClicker is a very popular in-class polling system used by professors to take attendance, ask questions, and even give quizzes. For such a popular system, and one that impacts a students' grade in a class, we wanted to explore how secure the network is.

In this project, we show that it's possible to create a system to capture iClicker responses from within a classroom. We explored various ways to display the captured data. 

This was incredibly fun and educational. If you want to make your own iCapture system, feel free to use the resources I've linked below or contact me.

We do not endorse using this system for any form of cheating.
